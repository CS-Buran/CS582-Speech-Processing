# Create and print examples of the basic Python types
# Write a function named ex1() containing the following functionality:
# 1. An integer 1 named 'int1'

# 2. A floating point number = 2.0 named 'float1'

# 3. A complex number containing the value 3 - 3i named 'complex1'

# 4. A string containg the value "Hello World" named 'string1'

# 5. A list containing the values 'a', 0, 'b', '2', 'c', 3 named 'list1'

# 6. A dictionary named 'dictionary1' containing the values 1,2,3,4

# 7. A tuple named 'tuple1' containg the values 0,1

# 8. A boolean named 'boolean1' = false
# 9. Invoke ex1() to print results

print ("********** Exercise 1.2 **********")
# Write your code below each prompt
# Create a function called ex2() which:
# 1. Prompts the user for their name
# 2. Writes the text entry to the file tmp1.txt
# 3. Reads the value from the file
# 4. Print the value read from the file
# 5. Invoke ex2() to print results

print ("********** Exercise 1.3 **********")
# Write a function called ex3(n) which
# 1. accepts as an input parameter an integer between 1 and 100
# 2. Calculates and print the mersenne primes between 1 and this number
#    See en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_prime for details
# 3. Invoke ex3(16) to print results

print ("********** Exercise 1.4 **********")
# Write a function called ex4() which implements a "Guess the number" game
# 1. Generate a random number between 1 and 100
#    See https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html for random number
#    generation details
# 1. Prompt the user with the rules of the game ('q' to quit)
# 2. Iterively prompt a user for a guess
# 3. Let the user know whether their last guess was high or low
# 4. Count the number of guesses
# 5. Congratulate them upon success. Print the number of guesses
# 6. Prompt to play again or quit
# 7. Proceed as directed by user.
# 8. Invoke ex4() and play a game to print results
